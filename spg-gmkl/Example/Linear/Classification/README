Directory PrecomputedKernels contain a kernelfile, train/test labels, 26 precomputed train/test kernels and a modelfile.
The kernels and labels are obtained for dataset heart_scale by randomly dividing the data in 4:1 ratio. Using 80% of data for training
and remaining 20% for testing.
model_file is obtained using the following command:
svm-train -s 0 -h 0 -m 400 -o 2.0 -a 26 -c 10.0 -l 1.0 -f 0 -j 1 -g 3 -k Example/Linear/Classification/PrecomputedKernels/kernelfile Example/Linear/Classification/PrecomputedKernels/y_train Example/Linear/Classification/PrecomputedKernels/model_file
Note: Since only precomputed kernels are used, actual training data is not required. Only labels are needed
In order to get the calssification accuracy use the following command:
svm-predict Example/Linear/Classification/PrecomputedKernels/y_test Example/Linear/Classification/PrecomputedKernels/model_file Example/Linear/Classification/PrecomputedKernels/prediction

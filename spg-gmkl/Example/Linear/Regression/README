Directory toy contain kernelfile, training and test data. Regression data is from dataset housing (which is available on http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/). Data is divided in the ratio of 4:1. Four parts are used for training and remaining one part is used for testing 
Kernels in this case will be computed on the fly. In order to train fire the following command
svm-train -s 3 -h 0 -m 400 -o 1.1 -a 10 -c 10.0 -l 1.0 -f 0 -j 1 -g 3 -k Example/Linear/Regression/toy/kernelfile Example/Linear/Regression/toy/y_train Example/Linear/Regression/toy/model_file
Above command will generate a model_file in Example/Linear/Regression/toy/ directory
In order to get the calssification accuracy use the following command:
svm-predict Example/Linear/Regression/toy/y_test Example/Linear/Regression/toy/model_file Example/Linear/Regression/toy/prediction  
Above command will generate a prediction file in Example/Linear/Regression/toy/ directory
